            <span style="font-size: 24px;">The size and complexity of Salesforce means that many repeatable tasks are performed manually by sales
                reps, marketeers and managers over and over every day. In a medium-sized company, it's not unusual to
                have manual workflows that take hundreds of hours to perform daily, which could (and quite possibly,
                should) be automated.</span>
